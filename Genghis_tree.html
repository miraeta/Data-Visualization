    <h2>Genghis Khan - Family Tree</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Add a brief text section to your page where 1) motivate your choices (e.g. choice of color/marks,
            overall layout etc), and 2) Suggest how/if the visualization could be improved by adding interactive
            elements.
        </li>

            <li>
                I wanted to create a very basic family-tree in order to visualize Genghis Khan's genealogy.<br>
                Females are colored in purple and males in green.
            </li>
            <li>
                The visualization could be improved by making it interactive for:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                   Being able to move the tree as we wish and focusing in specific branches.
                </li>
                <li>Clicking at people's boxes and expanding additional information about their lifes</li>
            </ul>
